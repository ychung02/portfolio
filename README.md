1. A collection of coding experiments.
2. A portfolio website that shows who I am as a designer.

##The Collection
I wanted to create a collection of projects that I will contintue to upload. These were my first tryouts for coding and I used images of James Turrell to develop my concept.

##Portfolio
To learn more about basic coding and further more, I began to build a portfolio website. I learned most from building this website and I want to continue this exploration.
